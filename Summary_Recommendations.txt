Overview: This analysis aims to build a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for predicting the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations. The model acts as a binary classifier, determining whether an organization will be successful based on provided features.
Results:
Data Preprocessing:
Target Variable:
The target variable is IS_SUCCESSFUL.
Feature Variables:
Features include APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, and others.
Variables Removed:
EIN and NAME columns were removed as they aren't targets or features.
Model Building:
Architecture:
The model has an input layer, hidden layers (adjusted during optimization), and an output layer.
Input layer neurons match the number of features, and hidden layers use ReLU activation.
Output layer has one neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Performance:
The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy here] on the test dataset.
Optimization Attempts:
Adjusted neurons and layers, explored different activations, and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
Summary: The model predicts success with [insert accuracy here]. Achieving over 75% accuracy proved challenging despite optimization attempts. Further feature engineering, algorithm exploration, or ensemble methods may enhance classification.
Recommendation: Explore ensemble models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for improved performance on diverse datasets. In-depth feature engineering and analysis could enhance generalization to new data.
